# XPLM Display APIs - THEORY OF OPERATION
# *****************************************************************************
#
# This API provides the basic hooks to draw in X-Plane and create user
# interface. All X-Plane drawing is done in OpenGL.  The X-Plane plug-in
# manager takes care of properly setting up the OpenGL context and matrices.
# You do not decide when in your code's  execution to draw; X-Plane tells you
# when it is ready to have your plugin draw.
#
# X-Plane's drawing strategy is straightforward: every "frame" the screen is
# rendered by drawing the 3-d scene (dome, ground, objects, airplanes, etc.)
# and then drawing the cockpit on top of it.  Alpha blending is used to
# overlay the cockpit over the world (and the gauges over the panel, etc.).
#
# There are two ways you can draw: directly and in a window.
#
# Direct drawing involves drawing to the screen before or after X-Plane
# finishes a phase of drawing.  When you draw directly, you can specify
# whether x-plane is to complete this phase or not.  This allows you to do
# three things: draw before x-plane does (under it), draw after x-plane does
# (over it), or draw instead of  x-plane.
#
# To draw directly, you register a callback and specify what phase you want
# to intercept.  The plug-in manager will call you over and over to draw that
# phase.
#
# Direct drawing allows you to override scenery, panels, or anything.  Note
# that  you cannot assume that you are the only plug-in drawing at this
# phase.
#
# Window drawing provides slightly higher level functionality.  With window
# drawing you create a window that takes up a portion of the screen.  Window
# drawing is always two dimensional.  Window drawing is front-to-back
# controlled; you can  specify that you want your window to be brought on
# top, and other plug-ins may put their window on top of you.  Window drawing
# also allows you to sign up for  key presses and receive mouse clicks.
#
# There are three ways to get keystrokes:
#
# If you create a window, the window can take keyboard focus.  It will then
# receive all keystrokes.  If no window has focus, X-Plane receives
# keystrokes.  Use this to implement typing in dialog boxes, etc.  Only one
# window may have focus at a time; your window will be notified if it loses
# focus.
#
# If you need to associate key strokes with commands/functions in your
# plug-in, use a hot key.  A hoy is a key-specific callback.  Hotkeys are
# sent based on virtual key strokes, so any key may be distinctly mapped with
# any modifiers.  Hot keys  can be remapped by other plug-ins.  As a plug-in,
# you don't have to worry about  what your hot key ends up mapped to; other
# plug-ins may provide a UI for remapping keystrokes.  So hotkeys allow a
# user to resolve conflicts and customize keystrokes.
#
# If you need low level access to the keystroke stream, install a key
# sniffer.  Key sniffers can be installed above everything or right in front
# of the sim.
#

#******************************************************************************
# Drawing Callbacks
# *****************************************************************************
#
# Basic drawing callbacks, for low level intercepting of render loop. The
# purpose of drawing callbacks is to provide targeted additions or
# replacements to x-plane's graphics environment (for example, to add extra
# custom objects, or replace drawing of the AI aircraft).  Do not assume that
# the drawing callbacks will be called in the order implied by the
# enumerations. Also do not assume that each drawing phase ends before
# another begins; they may be nested.

# XPLMDrawingPhase
#
# This constant indicates which part of drawing we are in.  Drawing is done
# from the back to the front.  We get a callback before or after each item.
# Metaphases provide access to the beginning and end of the 3d (scene) and 2d
# (cockpit) drawing in a manner that is independent of new phases added  via
# x-plane implementation.
#
# WARNING: As X-Plane's scenery evolves, some drawing phases may cease to
# exist and new ones may be invented.  If you need a particularly specific
# use of these codes, consult Austin and/or be prepared to revise your code
# as X-Plane evolves.
