# See license.txt for usage.

# This file is contains the cross-platform and basic definitions for the
# X-Plane SDK.
#
# The preprocessor macros APL and IBM must be defined to specify the
# compilation target; define APL to 1 and IBM 0 to compile on Macintosh and
# APL to 0 and IBM to 1 for Windows. You must specify these macro definitions
# before including XPLMDefs.h or any other XPLM headers.  You can do this
# using the -D command line option or a preprocessor header.

#  GLOBAL DEFINITIONS
# *****************************************************************************
#
#  These definitions are used in all parts of the SDK.
#

#  XPLMPluginID
#
#  Each plug-in is identified by a unique integer ID.  This ID can be used to
#  disable or enable a plug-in, or discover what plug-in is 'running' at the
#  time.  A plug-in ID is unique within the currently running instance of
#  X-Plane unless plug-ins are reloaded.  Plug-ins may receive a different
#  unique ID each time they are loaded.
#
#  For persistent identification of plug-ins, use XPLMFindPluginBySignature in
#  XPLMUtiltiies.h
#
#  -1 indicates no plug-in.

# The current XPLM revision is 2.10 (210).

##
#  XPLMKeyFlags
#
#  These bitfields define modifier keys in a platform independent way. When a
#  key is pressed, a series of messages are sent to your plugin.  The down
#  flag is set in the first of these messages, and the up flag in the last.
#  While the key is held down, messages are sent with neither to indicate that
#  the key is being held down as a repeated character.
#
#  The control flag is mapped to the control flag on Macintosh and PC.
#  Generally X-Plane uses the control key and not the command key on
#  Macintosh, providing a consistent interface across platforms that does not
#  necessarily match the Macintosh user interface guidelines.  There is not
#  yet a way for plugins to access the Macintosh control keys without using
#  #ifdefed code.
const
  xplm_ShiftFlag* = 1       # The shift key is down

  xplm_DownFlag* = 8        # The key is being pressed down
  xplm_UpFlag* = 16         # The key is being released

#******************************************************************************
#  ASCII CONTROL KEY CODES
# *****************************************************************************
#
#  These definitions define how various control keys are mapped to ASCII key
#  codes. Not all key presses generate an ASCII value, so plugin code should
#  be prepared to see null characters come from the keyboard...this usually
#  represents a key stroke that has no equivalent ASCII, like a page-down
#  press.  Use virtual key codes to find these key strokes. ASCII key codes
#  take into account modifier keys; shift keys will affect capitals and
#  punctuation; control key combinations may have no vaild ASCII and produce
#  NULL.  To detect control-key combinations, use virtual key codes, not ASCII
#  keys.

#******************************************************************************
#  VIRTUAL KEY CODES
# *****************************************************************************
#
#  These are cross-platform defines for every distinct keyboard press on the
#  computer. Every physical key on the keyboard has a virtual key code.  So
#  the "two" key on the  top row of the main keyboard has a different code
#  from the "two" key on the numeric key pad.  But the 'w' and 'W' character
#  are indistinguishable by virtual key code  because they are the same
#  physical key (one with and one without the shift key).
#
#  Use virtual key codes to detect keystrokes that do not have ASCII
#  equivalents, allow the user to map the numeric keypad separately from the
#  main keyboard, and detect control key and other modifier-key combinations
#  that generate ASCII control key sequences (many of which are not available
#  directly via character keys in the SDK).
#
#  To assign virtual key codes we started with the Microsoft set but made some
#  additions and changes.  A few differences:
#
#  1. Modifier keys are not available as virtual key codes.  You cannot get
#  distinct modifier press and release messages.  Please do not try to use
#  modifier keys as regular keys; doing so will almost certainly interfere
#  with users' abilities to use the native x-plane key bindings.
#
#  2. Some keys that do not exist on both Mac and PC keyboards are removed.
#
#  3. Do not assume that the values of these keystrokes are interchangeable
#  with MS v-keys.
