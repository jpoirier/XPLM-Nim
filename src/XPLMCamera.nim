# XPLMCamera - THEORY OF OPERATION The XPLMCamera APIs allow plug-ins to
# control the camera angle in X-Plane.  This has a number of applications,
# including but not limited to:
#
# - Creating new views (including dynamic/user-controllable views) for the
# user.
#
# - Creating applications that use X-Plane as a renderer of scenery,
# aircrafts, or both.
#
# The camera is controlled via six parameters: a location in OpenGL
# coordinates and pitch, roll and yaw, similar to an airplane's position.
# OpenGL coordinate info is described in detail in the XPLMGraphics
# documentation; generally you should use the XPLMGraphics routines to
# convert from world to local coordinates.  The camera's orientation starts
# facing level with the ground directly up the negative-Z axis
# (approximately north) with the horizon horizontal.  It is then rotated
# clockwise for yaw, pitched up for positive pitch, and rolled clockwise
# around the vector it is looking along for roll.
#
# You control the camera either either until the user selects a new view or
# permanently (the later being similar to how UDP camera control works).  You
# control the camera by registering a callback per frame from which you
# calculate the new camera positions.  This guarantees smooth camera motion.
#
# Use the XPLMDataAccess APIs to get information like the position of the
# aircraft, etc. for complex camera positioning.

# XPLMCameraPosition_t
#
# This structure contains a full specification of the camera.  X, Y, and Z
# are the camera's position in OpenGL coordiantes; pitch, roll, and yaw are
# rotations from a camera facing flat north in degrees.  Positive pitch means
# nose up, positive roll means roll right, and positive yaw means yaw right,
# all in degrees. Zoom is a zoom factor, with 1.0 meaning normal zoom and 2.0
# magnifying by 2x (objects appear larger).
