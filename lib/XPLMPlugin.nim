# FINDING PLUGINS
# *****************************************************************************
#
# These APIs allow you to find another plugin or yourself, or iterate across
# all plugins.  For example, if you wrote an FMS plugin that needed to talk
# to an autopilot plugin, you could use these APIs to locate the autopilot
# plugin.
#

# get your own ID.

# matches what is passed in or XPLM_NO_PLUGIN_ID if no running plug-in has this
# signature.  Signatures are the best way to identify another plug-in as they
# are independent of the file system path of a plug-in or the human-readable

#******************************************************************************
# INTERPLUGIN MESSAGING
# *****************************************************************************
#
# Plugin messages are defined as 32-bit integers.  Messages below 0x00FFFFFF
# are reserved for X-Plane and the plugin SDK.
#
# Messages have two conceptual uses: notifications and commands.  Commands
# are  sent from one plugin to another to induce behavior; notifications are
# sent  from one plugin to all others for informational purposes.  It is
# important that commands and notifications not have the same values because
# this could cause a notification sent by one plugin to accidentally induce a
# command in another.
#
# By convention, plugin-defined notifications should have the high bit set
# (e.g. be greater or equal to unsigned 0x8000000) while commands should have
# this bit be cleared.
#
# The following messages are sent to your plugin by x-plane.
#

# This message is sent to your plugin whenever the user's plane crashes.
const
       XPLM_MSG_PLANE_CRASHED* = 101

# This message is sent to your plugin whenever a new plane is loaded.  The
# parameter is the number of the plane being loaded; 0 indicates the user's
# plane.
const
       XPLM_MSG_PLANE_LOADED* = 102

# This messages is called whenever the user's plane is positioned at a new
# airport.
const
       XPLM_MSG_AIRPORT_LOADED* = 103

# This message is sent whenever new scenery is loaded.  Use datarefs to
# determine the new scenery files that were loaded.
const
       XPLM_MSG_SCENERY_LOADED* = 104

# This message is sent whenever the user adjusts the number of X-Plane
# aircraft models.  You must use XPLMCountPlanes to find out how many planes
# are now available.  This message will only be sent in XP7 and higher
# because in XP6 the number of aircraft is not user-adjustable.
const
       XPLM_MSG_AIRPLANE_COUNT_CHANGED* = 105

# This message is sent to your plugin whenever a plane is unloaded.  The
# parameter is the number of the plane being unloaded; 0 indicates the user's
# plane.  The parameter is of type int, passed as the value of the pointer.
# (That is: the parameter is an int, not a pointer to an int.)
const
       XPLM_MSG_PLANE_UNLOADED* = 106

# This message is sent to your plugin right before X-Plane writes its
# preferences file.  You can use this for two purposes: to write your own
# preferences, and to modify any datarefs to influence preferences output.
# For example, if your plugin temporarily modifies saved preferences, you can
# put them back to their default values here to avoid  having the tweaks be
# persisted if your plugin is not loaded on the next invocation of X-Plane.
const
       XPLM_MSG_WILL_WRITE_PREFS* = 107

# This message is sent to your plugin right after a livery is loaded for an
# airplane.  You can use this to check the new livery (via datarefs) and
# react accordingly.  The parameter is of type int, passed as the value of a
# pointer and represents the aicraft plane number - 0 is the user's plane.
const
       XPLM_MSG_LIVERY_LOADED* = 108

# XPLMSendMessageToPlugin sends a message to another plug-in or X-Plane.  Pass
# XPLM_NO_PLUGIN_ID to broadcast to all plug-ins.  Only enabled plug-ins with
# a message receive function receive the message.

# Plugin Features API
# *****************************************************************************

# The plugin features API allows your plugin to "sign up" for additional

# backward compatibility.  This allows advanced plugins to "opt-in" to new
# behavior.
#
# Each feature is defined by a permanent string name.  The feature string
# names will vary with the particular  installation of X-Plane, so plugins
# should not expect a feature to be guaranteed present.
