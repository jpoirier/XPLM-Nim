Based on X-Plane SDK Release 2.1.3 11/14/13 (http://www.xsquawkbox.net/xpsdk/).
See license.txt for usage.


To build the plugin example
---------------------------
$ nim c -d:release -d:useRealtimeGC XPLM_Test.nim
$ nim c -d:release -d:useNimRtl XPLM_Test.nim

Rename xplm_test/.dll/.so/.dynlib to xplm_test.xpl and copy to the X-Plane plugin folder,
X-Plane10/Resources/plugins.


To build the CommViewer plugin
------------------------------
$ nim c -d:release -d:useRealtimeGC CommViewer.nim
For usage info visit: https://github.com/jpoirier/xplane-commviewer-plugin


To generate the "nimrtl.dll" file, in the Nim compiler source directory, use the command:
	$ nim c -d:release lib/nimrtl.nim

To link against nimrtl.dll use the command:
	$ nim c -d:useNimRtl myprog.nim

XPLM_Test.nim and CommViewer.nim were tested on Linux. The plugin was looking for
XPWidgets_64.so and XPLM_64.so in the default lib location (/usr/lib) and I had
to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to X-Plane's plugin folder.

TODO:
- set the proper search path for XPLM_64.so and XPWidgets_64.so.
- review the wrapper parameters against the c function prototypes and delete
  the prototype comments when validated
